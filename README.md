# Video Streaming Platform

### This is a video streaming platform in React using HLS (Http Live Streaming) Protocol. It uses [react-hls-player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-hls) library to stream the videos.

Installation

- Install dependencies using `npm install ----legacy-peer-deps` (--legacy-peer-deps option should be used while installation as react-hls-player package is built on top of React 16.8 so it throws an error with compatibiltiy issue for react 18)
- Run the app using `npm run dev`
